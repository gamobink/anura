Prerequisites:

You need a recent compiler, because of the use of C++11 features in the engine. The minimum 
required version of GCC is 4.8. Versions of clang post 3.1 should work as well. There are build
files for MSVC (requires 2013 desktop edition) for windows and Xcode (requires 4.6 or later).

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to 
build the Anura engine:

 boost_iostreams >= 1.50.0
 boost_filesystem >= 1.50.0
 boost_regex >= 1.50.0
 boost_asio >= 1.50.0
 boost_system >= 1.50.0
 libsdl >= 2.0.0
 libsdl-image >= 2.0.0 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 2.0.0 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.12
 gl
 glew
 libz
 imgui (available as a git submodule)
 icu-i18n

Building:

It is recommended to install the program 'ccache' as this can considerably
speed up build times for subsequent builds. This is however not required.
To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you 
may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'anura' will be 
created which you can run.

To access the level editor, press CTRL-E during the game.

Have fun!
